# Non-Euclidean-Gradient-Methods-for-Matrix-Completion-in-Gene-Prioritization

This repository currently contains the code and data to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Gene prioritization using Bayesian matrix factorization with genomic and phenotypic side information". The study proposes a novel method for gene prioritization by combining Bayesian matrix factorization (BMF) with additional genomic and phenotypic side information, enabling robust predictions and improved identification of disease-associated genes.
